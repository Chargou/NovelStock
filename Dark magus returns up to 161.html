<p>164 &nbsp;Extract Everything n-)O????In</p><p> A level 2 power stone was something hard to come by. Raze hadn't even seen it at the normal markets, so he assumed that it was something that was mostly either given to the second-year students at the Pagna Academy or something that you could only get at an Auction house or something similar. </p><p> He still wasn't very well-versed in the World of Pagna, so he could only base it on the things he saw. Either way, he was delighted. Not only had he obtained a level 2 power stone, but achieving it wasn't too much of a hard task. The beast he had defeated using a combination of his magic and Pagna skills produced a devastating blow. </p><p> "I'm going to be busy for a bit!" Raze shouted out. "Just protect me, or stop anything from getting close to me if you see it." </p><p> Raze didn't give time for Dame to reply, and immediately he had run back up the mountain and was now hiding behind a tree. Since the snow was still thick, he used his finger to draw circles in the snow. His finger quickly turned red and was getting numb, but he didn't care. The excitement, along with the adrenaline, was too much for him, and shortly after, he had finished drawing the circle. </p><p> "What is he up to?" Dame said to himself as he made his way back up. It didn't seem like there would be any beasts coming after them, but if they were to head further down, it might be a different story. </p><p> Having looked at the dead beast that was on the ground before, the image of what Raze had done just moments before had flashed in his head. The attack was strong, strong enough to take out a level 2 beast like that. </p><p> 'Raze, I'm starting to wonder, do you have any idea how strong you are?' Dame thought to himself. 'You were able to take out a head disciple that was at the third stage, and you had done so using your skills as a Pagna warrior and now with your magic. </p><p> 'But when you combine your magic and skills together, you're able to create something out of this world. Even though you are a Stage 2 warrior, I would think you could take on a Stage 4 at the moment.' </p><p> What Raze was currently doing was absorbing the level 2 power stone. He was adding its strength to his power core because it had the attribute of Ice. After absorbing the crystal, it meant now on top of Wind and Dark, he would also be able to use ice as well. </p><p> Taking in one deep breath, the remains of the crystal energy had disappeared, and they had been added to his magic core. </p><p> 'It's a success!' Raze said as he stood up from his position from the tree. He immediately noticed that his body didn't feel as cold as it did before. It was proof that it had worked. </p><p> 'It's a shame I can't tell how strong the attribute is. I'll have to create another ring? I wonder, do I even have enough fingers to have rings for all the elements!' Raze thought. 'Either way, now that I have the ice attribute, I can increase its affinity.' </p><p> When walking back to Dame, Raze started to ponder. Ice was one of the types of magic that Raze didn't have much knowledge of. So much so that he didn't even know what one was meant to do to naturally increase its affinity, other than to absorb more ice-related power stones. That's when another idea had popped into his head as he came across Dame. </p><p> "Ah, did the crystal go? I thought that you would have wanted to create an item with it, or a Qi pill. What did you even use it for?" Dame asked. </p><p> "I used it for my magic," Raze said as he swiped his hand through the falling snow, and it started to freeze over. As it got heavy, it fell into the snow right after. "I can't always use power stones for items; I need to balance myself so I'm not so reliant on one or the other. Speaking of, do you know any Pagna techniques that could relate to the ice element in any way?" </p><p> Dame started to scratch the side of his chin as he was trying to work out if he did or not. </p><p> "I can't say I do honestly, but we should be heading to the library soon, so honestly, we should know by then," Dame explained. "But why do you need a cultivation technique?" </p><p> The cultivation techniques of this world were also able to strengthen Raze's core as long as it matched the affinity he was trying to train. </p><p> "It just helps with gathering a specific type of energy sometimes," Raze explained. </p><p> "Ah, I see now," Dame said as he walked over, and the two of them were next to the large snake-type dead beast that they had killed. "You need the crystal because it gives you ice-type powers for your magic, but what about the body?" </p><p> "The body?" Raze asked. </p><p> "The body," Dame replied and placed his hand on one side of the creature's head. "You see, a lot of power is in the power stones inside them, but there is also lingering power in their bodies as well. If you take the power from the bodies to increase your magic, you keep the level 2 power stones for yourself?" </p><p> It was in Dame's best interest to get Raze as many crystals as he could because he would be buying and selling them as well, but they needed crystals to do such things. </p><p> Closing his eyes, Dame looked as if he was focusing on something. That's when all the veins on his left arm started to show. They were bulging as if he had next to no skin on his body. </p><p> Flowing from the beast, the energy was running through his veins and inside him. It only took ten seconds or so, but Dame was done, and he was hoping it had managed to make some type of impression. </p><p> "What I used was an extraction technique belonging to the Demonic Faction. That body still had plenty of energy, and it's useful to take it right after one kills," Dame explained. </p><p> Watching carefully, Raze could feel the energy moving from the dead beast into Dame. It was no joke; the issue was, the mages didn't have an ability like that at all. </p><p> "Why don't you teach me this extraction skill of yours?" Raze asked, and he had done so in a somewhat polite way, which wasn't like him. </p><p> "As much as I would love to, I can't," Dame replied. "This isn't my skill; this is the Demonic Faction skill. Honestly, I'm not sure if you showed those skills like you did in front of the Dark Faction, that my Demonic faction would act the same way." </p><p> Raze felt like it was too late for him to go back on what he had just heard; he needed that skill because he knew how well he could use it now and in the future. </p><p> "If you teach me how to use that skill, then I'll make you another item, and who knows how strong that will be this time," Raze said. </p><p> Hearing the words "another item," and from the Dark Magus no less, it was an offer that Dame couldn't refuse. </p><p> "Another item, huh? I guess as long as you keep it a secret, it will be okay. Let's teach you the extraction technique." </p><p> Mass release goals go! </p><p> 500 Golden tickets = 1 Extra Chapter </p><p> 2500 Power stoens = 1 Extra Chapter </p><p> 1 Caslte gift and above = 1 Extra Chapter </p><p> &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Chapter 165 &nbsp;Stronger than Before</h3> <p> </p><p> The extraction technique wasn't just a technique that one clan knew in the Demonic Faction; it was actually a technique that was known among the top clans in the faction, and it was due to this technique that the faction's name had somewhat come from. </p><p> It was a trade secret among the top clans, and yet here Dame was giving it away with ease. That was all because he couldn't say no to having one of Dark Magus' items. The Qi pills he had made were a game-changer for any clan. </p><p> However, the items that he would enchant, that the others had yet to get their hands on, were like owning an entire gold mine. If Raze was willing to make him an item of the same quality or higher, he would happily teach him any of the Demonic Faction secrets. </p><p> In a way, Raze liked this about Dame because his loyalty was by his own values, rather than what a group of people told him to do. </p><p> "I've already extracted the energy out of this beast, so we can't tell you if it will work or not, but I can teach you the feeling of it," Dame explained. "You already know how to cultivate using the circle of life and death, so it should help you with this as well. n-)O????In</p><p> "The same feeling as when one is cultivating needs to be used, but the energy from within when cultivating, rather than going to your dantian, needs to head to the palm of your hand instead. </p><p> "When you have this feeling ready, you touch the object which you wish to use the extraction technique on, and this is where things get a bit difficult. The cultivation technique you need to use needs to be directed to what you are touching. </p><p> "You are using the same cultivation technique but drawing the energy from what's on your palm. Then you draw that into your dantian, and that is the extraction technique." </p><p> Raze was listening carefully, and he was also imagining the movements in his head. He could cultivate with the life and death technique quite well. Placing it into his palm, it actually seemed like it would be no problem at all. </p><p> 'I wonder if I can adjust the technique, if the energy has a certain trait like these beasts with the ice attribute, I should be able to attract the energy into my core, thus increasing my affinity with certain magic, right?' Raze thought. </p><p> That wasn't the only thought in his head, though, because thinking about this technique and flowing the energy through his hand, he had another idea. </p><p> "Based on what you're saying, wouldn't this technique also be used on the living?" Raze asked. </p><p> faded as he gazed off into the distance, as if he was thinking about something. "The Demonic Faction is called demonic because of what you just said. </p><p> "You catch on quick," Dame said, as he managed to perform a half-smile, but it quickly faded as he gazed off into the distance, as if he was thinking about something. "The Demonic Faction is called demonic because of what you just said. </p><p> "This technique is honestly useless in the hands of most to be used in battle. Think about it, you would have to hold onto your opponent and stay in contact with them. Do you think they aren't going to fight back?" </p><p> "Honestly as well, most can't use the technique well enough to draw out a large amount of energy so fast. However, that is not true for all. There are those that can use it very well. Those that have done in the past, draw out the energy for others like you say, but taking a life all for the sake of growing stronger, that's what brought on the name of the Demonic Faction. </p><p> "The Light Faction, who train diligently, like martial arts in some way is to get into the heavens above. While the Dark Faction train to fight in a way that they believe winning is the only thing that matters. As for the Demonic Faction, getting stronger off the lives of others, well, it doesn't sit too well, does it? If you want my advice, even if you end up being extremely skillful at using the Extraction Technique, don't use it on humans, don't become a demon." </p><p> The words from Dame had hit Raze more than he would know. Although Raze wouldn't willingly take lives unless he couldn't afford not to, he had already killed others for the sake of his goal. Even the way he had gotten here. Many would have already called him a demon. </p><p> Since they needed to find a new beast, the two of them continued to head down the mountain. Just like before, they could see something rumbling through the snow. Raze gave Dame a look as to tell him not to do anything. </p><p> Just like last time, Raze continued to use wind strikes with his sword one after the other. The condition of increasing the affinity with Wind magic was to use spells more and more. Making it the quickest to grow but also the hardest to max out at the same time. It was tough as well because being a 2-star mage also meant Raze didn't have a lot of Mana. </p><p> 'I really need to gather a lot more normal power stones so I can make normal Mana pills. Because the uncommon mana pill is only good for emergency situations,' Raze thought. </p><p> With it, Raze had decided to test out one more thing. He had tested out his strength of the sword technique with his magic, now he wanted to test out his Dark Pulse. </p><p> Jumping back, it looked like the snake beast was heavily injured. It opened its mouth, letting out the light blue substance. As it went right towards Raze, he had timed the second descending step perfectly, so he would avoid the attack darting forward through the snow. He then threw his hand out at the same time. </p><p> "Dark Pulse!" Raze shouted. </p><p> When thrusting out his hand, he had used Qi to throw out his fist. The step to the punch had done the same as it would have done with the sword. It increased the power of his magic as well. </p><p> The pulse released from the Dark Pulse was nearly twice as large as that which came out from his hand, and it shot out like a solid beam going right through the beast's head. A large hole around the size of a thick tree branch had been made, and the beast fell to the side dead. </p><p> As soon as the beast had died, the strange mist went into Raze. Thankfully, with the ring, he also got part of his Mana back as well. When his body absorbed the energy, he also could feel his Dark Core getting stronger. </p><p> [Dark attribute: 31 &gt;&gt;&gt; 32] [Wind attribute: 16 &gt;&gt;&gt; 18] </p><p> 'My magic powers are already increasing from this; it was a good idea to come here after all.' </p><p> Raze went ahead to the body, in order to retrieve the crystal. As he did, Dame couldn't help but watch Raze. He was looking at what he had done carefully just now. </p><p> 'That attack, he's mixing his martial arts with his magic, isn't he? If I'm not wrong. I think his magic is getting stronger with those techniques. That attack from before that he just performed. It would have been enough to kill the Level 2 beast in one hit. So why did he bother to use all those small attacks from before?' </p><p> The world of magic was interesting to Dame, but he knew the Dark Magus wouldn't teach him; it was his trump card after all. For now, he would just have to make do with the items he had obtained. </p><p> After receiving the crystal, it was time for Raze to get to work. Dame had jumped from his position, landing in the snow now not too far from Raze. He could see him closing his eyes and focusing to see how he was getting on. </p><p> To his surprise, or not to his surprise now, he seemed to be using the technique well. Dame could see the veins showing on the palm of his hand. They were bulging as it looked like energy was entering into him. </p><p> For Raze, it was incredibly easy; it was just as Dame had explained, and he was thankful for the clear explanation. Now, though, he just needed to redirect the energy to his core. He had moved it successfully, and when it finally entered his core, Raze was more than delighted. Finally, all of the energy was absorbed, and he let go with his hand, only after a couple of seconds. </p><p> 'The energy, it worked, because the beast had the ice attribute, I could feel the ice affinity getting stronger!' </p><p> Raze now could decide to either absorb the level 2 crystals and continue increasing his ice affinity, or he could use it to create more items, and for now, he had decided to keep it for the latter. </p><p> 'With each beast I kill, I gain affinity with Wind Magic for using the spells, Dark Magic for killing the beast, and now Ice Magic for using the extraction technique as well, and I can even use the stones.' </p><p> This reminded Raze of the old times when he would have to constantly hunt in the dimensions to increase his growth. It took him years to eventually become a 9-star mage, but with the additional help of him being a Pagna warrior, he was growing at a much faster rate. </p><p> "Let's continue the hunt," Raze said. "I'm going to come back stronger than before. If they thought the Dark Magus was something they had to worry about, they have no idea." </p><p> ---- </p><p> Up the slope around the halfway point of the large mountain where the portal was placed, it was flickering slightly. After a few flickers more, a group of people bunched up together, four in total, had jumped right through, landing in the snow. </p><p> Gunther immediately got up, looking at the site around him, and the three students lifted their heads, covered in snow. </p><p> "Are we really here?" Simyon said. "Did we really go to another dimension?" </p><p> &nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h3>Chapter 166 &nbsp;A Freezing Situation</h3> <p> </p><p> A constant chattering sound was going off, like a beetle making a type of mating call. However, the sound wasn't due to any beetle; it was all because of three young students who couldn't help but clatter their teeth together. </p><p> They were all huddled up close to one another as they moved through the snow, slowly one step at a time. </p><p> "Come on, it isn't that bad, will you guys stop exaggerating?" Gunther asked. </p><p> "Wha-wha- what type of teacher are you?" Simyon eventually said, stuttering a few times due to the cold. "You forced us in here, you practically pushed us, and now you don't look after us." </p><p> "My balls!" Liam shouted out. "I think they're going inside my stomach... it's too cold, I want to have kids! Don't do this to me!" </p><p> Unlike the other two boys, Safa wasn't complaining about the situation. Not that she could vocally if she wanted to. Instead, she was taking deep breaths and trying to focus her Qi. </p><p> She noticed that activating it ever so slightly through her body was warming it up. She needed to be careful because using too much would eventually make her feel more exhausted, and if that were the case, she wouldn't have enough to fight either. Right now, they were in a dangerous place. </p><p> "Hey!" Gunther shouted back. "I'm doing the right thing, aren't I? I'm here with you, and with me, you guys won't have any problems; you don't have to worry about that. Besides, the next assessment was going to be portal exploration anyway, so you're just getting a head start!" </p><p> Since Gunther was a higher-staged warrior, he couldn't feel the cold, and with all three of the students being 1st-stage warriors, they could bear it only a little more than that of a regular human. </p><p> It wasn't as if there were no snowy areas back on Pagna, but they at least would have prepared if they knew about it beforehand. </p><p> "Fine, look, you all need to do the same as the girl is doing. Activate the Qi, a trickle amount throughout your whole body. Think about how you activate your Qi when you use your skills or perform a hit of some sort; that same feeling needs to be spread around your body but ever so gently, and then you'll be able to stand the cold a bit more." </p><p> The students, hearing his words and wanting to do anything to battle the cold, had instantly tried what he had said, and due to the desperate situation they were in, they were more focused than they would have been. </p><p> Gunther hadn't told them this from the get-go because part of the portal exploration assessment that they would do next month was to adapt to the situation they were in. Dimension portals led to all sorts of different environments. </p><p> They wanted the students to figure out solutions for themselves, but he just pitied them too much. </p><p> 'The girl is good, the two boys could take a leaf from her book,' Gunther smiled. </p><p> Once the boys were able to stop hanging onto Safa, the three of them could move a lot easier. Although it was more difficult for them. As they walked, it didn't take long for them to find tracks of other people. </p><p> "There, it looks like two footprints!" Liam shouted. "That must be Raze and Pink; the two of them had to have come in here." </p><p> "Ah, to be young," Gunther smiled. "I remembered all the reckless things I did as well. If I were in their situation, I perhaps would have done the same." </p><p> Gunther wondered if this place was the route of Raze's strength. When he had been knocked down by the other disciples, if he had found this portal to this world. He had trained and grown stronger before returning. </p><p> It made sense not to talk about the portal, so he could use it again for himself. However, this theory had quickly proven to be wrong, as soon as they had discovered something grand in the snow. </p><p> "Ah!" Liam shouted and jumped backwards. Distracted by everything around him, he had nearly walked right into it, the dead body of a beast. </p><p> "Its head, it's been split in half, but how, neither of them had a sword, right? They just have the wooden training swords, how then could they make this deep of a cut?" Simyon asked. </p><p> That wasn't the question Gunther thought of though. He looked at the long body of the beast. From its size and the hard scales on its body, he couldn't imagine this being a simple level 1 beast. This at least had to be a level 2. </p><p> "With Raze's strength, a level 2 wouldn't be too much trouble. Especially if he has Pink by his side as well. But the kids do have a point. How was this possible with no sword?" Gunther kept thinking back to the event. </p><p> Raze was able to make cuts on the other students. Everyone assumed that it was the techniques he had used, was it the same again here? </p><p> Going around the beast, Gunther stuck closer to the children. Having brought them here, the last thing he wanted to do was get them hurt, but perhaps they could still get some experience out of all of this. With the three of them, he hoped they could use their skills to combat against a level 2 beast. </p><p> When continuing down the mountain though, they didn't come across other beasts; instead, they had just come across more dead beast corpses. This one had a large hole in its head but had the same type of cuts all over its body. </p><p> "What type of move could even do this?" Gunther was now the one wondering. </p><p> They didn't spend much time examining the beast as they had seen it before, but the sight in front of them didn't change. They saw beast after beast, the same snake type killed. </p><p> They were walking through, and the bodies were getting more frequent, as they came across more closer together. </p><p> "Is all of this really the result of just two people, two students? A level 2 should still give them some trouble. I have to be ready for anything we meet. It might not be the students that are in here after all," Gunther thought. </p><p> Thankfully, he had taken his trusty blades on his back and had his armor on underneath his uniform. This was because Gunther was always ready for an attack at any time. </p><p> Continuing to walk, they finally could hear something. The sound of grunting off in the distance. The screeches and squeals of what sounded like a beast. The land was starting to level out, and the snow wasn't as thick as before either. </p><p> "Do you think that's them?" Liam asked. </p><p> Gunther decided to run ahead. </p><p> "You three keep up and stay close, be ready for anything," Gunther said, and he was doing his best to hide his smile. </p><p> Another teacher perhaps would have run back or thought of the children first, but Gunther didn't even want to become a teacher. He was doing a favor for his clan. Before this, he had entered portal after portal, all with the idea of getting stronger. </p><p> Thinking about who might be ahead, it was getting him excited. Through the snow, they could see a strange setup not too far in the distance. </p><p> It looked like a remote outpost had been built. There were strange wooden spikes that had been set up, making a type of wall. Several towers were built behind the wall, the other dimensions. In most of them, they had these; it was just they never found some of them destroyed while others were left standing. </p><p> It wasn't strange to see structures like these, structures that looked more human in the other dimensions. In most of them, they had these; it was just they never found any life that was like that of a human. </p><p> As they got closer to the outpost, they went past even more of the giant dead snakes. These looked different from the others. They had been killed more cleanly, with fewer hits. </p><p> The sound of fighting was growing louder as they got closer, and Gunther wanted to pick up his pace but hadn't done due to the children behind him. Then when they finally entered the outpost, they could see what was happening. </p><p> The barracks were large, and deep in the center, fighting was taking place. There were two that were battling against a large number of the beasts. There were now six of them and more coming from another direction toward them. </p><p> Jumping up in the air, one had black gauntlets and threw out a fist, hitting the beast in the head. Half of its head exploded on the spot, killing it. As for the other, they recognized straight away. </p><p> "That's Raze, it's him!" Liam said. "They both are here, and it looks like they're in trouble." </p><p> Doing the two-step shift, Raze slashed his sword vertically; he had used the second formation of the Devil's strike along with his wing power. Having created a deep cut, he had hurt it badly but it wasn't dead. </p><p> That's when, from his right side, another of the snakes came right at him, trying to eat him up in a bite, but placing his hand out, Raze had started to gather his dark magic, and with a sword in one hand and his palm open facing the other, he said two words. </p><p> "Dark pulse!" </p><p> The attack blasted right into the snake's mouth. It wasn't enough to kill it since he hadn't used any of his martial arts with it, but it veered the attack off course, causing it to fall and skid its head across the ground. </p><p> Meanwhile, the unknown onlookers had seen everything. </p><p> "What was that dark beam that had just come out of his hand?" Gunther said, his body trembling; he was ecstatic. </p><p> &nbsp;n/.?-.?)(?//?./?)/I.-n</p>

</div>
<p>167 &nbsp;The Noctis Clan </p><p> Raze and both Dame had continued to go down the mountain slope, and as they did, they noticed that the number of beasts that were coming towards them was increasing. Because of this, Raze had to change his tactic with how he dealt with the beasts. For one, he started to use more of his Qi like skills. He fought them with his sword, and added the wind magic at the end while getting closer and attacking them more physically. Fighting this way allowed him to use less mana, and he had perfected it in such a way, where he would gain enough mana from killing the beast back to what he used. This would allow him to carry on hunting without taking a break. </p><p> In turn, it allowed him to increase his wind affinity along with all his other attributes. From time to time, two beasts would come towards him and fighting the way Raze was fighting, he needed a little help. Dame would hold them off for as long as he needed to, and then when Raze was done, allowed him to fight as well. Dame was getting more and more curious as to why Raze was fighting the way he was fighting, especially when he had skills that could kill the beast in one go. 'It might have something to do with the energy he uses. Maybe it's just like martial arts with more skills taking up more Qi, and he's conserving his energy.' What was soon becoming apparent though, was just how much energy Raze had in terms of Qi and mana. Because as he looked to continue going on, he hadn't even consumed any of the pills that he had brought with him. </p><p> Yet, he was constantly able to use magic, little did he know it was all because of the items that were created. If Dame did know, then his love for these powerful items that had saved him once, would continue to grow, </p><p> Finally they had reached the end of the slope of the mountain and as they walked ahead they could see a strange outpost. "It's just like all the other dimensions." Raze commented. "They seem to have traces of an advanced civilization, or at least a society of some sort, but there's no life. Is it the same for all the dimensions in Pagna?" </p><p> While he was here, and since Dame was learning more about him everyday, he should learn more about the world of Pagna as well. There was something odd about it all, about the entire thing. </p><p> "I guess it's the same in your world of Alterian." Dame replied. "What you say is true. Nearly every dimension that leads to either a world is just filled with beasts, or one that has castles, buildings, and structures but no sign of life other than the beasts themselves." "You are honestly the first I have heard of a person from another dimension. Which was why I was excited to get to know you." </p><p> It was clear that he wasn't the first, since there was a whole group of those in Alter, but Raze felt like he knew who might have been the first and someone who was more like him compared to the other otherworlders. Although this still wasn't confirmed either. The otherworlders had come here from some type of portal of sorts, while Raze had transmigrated into a new body altogether. He had used an item. One that was most likely even above the Mythical grade in order to get him here, and it was an item that was discovered in one of these worlds. </p><p> "I know you're from the Demonic Faction, but I was wondering, do you know much about the Dark Faction's founder?" Raze asked. </p><p> Dame turned his head, trying to have a look at Raze's expression. In a sense the question didn't make much sense, why would Raze care about someone who had died long ago, when he was from another world, and why specifically this person. </p><p> "I know of him, but I do not know him." Dame replied back. "It's an interesting question that you ask though. Do you remember what Clan I said I was part of when we first joined the academy." </p><p> Raze did remember, because he was surprised at the reaction of Gunther at the time as well. "The Noctis clan?" Raze replied. "Correct, you see the reason why I knew that would catch their attention, is because the Noctis Clan, is the Clan that the Dark Faction's founder had created himself. There were of course clans before his, but before the Dark Faction existed as a whole, he was from this clan." Raze was still struggling to know what exactly was the big deal, so what if he was from the same Clan as the founder, why did that matter? But then it hit him. Why hadn't he heard of the clan before? The five main clans that currently made up the Dark Faction. The Noctis Clan wasn't one of them. "I know what your thinking." Dame replied. "The answer is the Noctis Clan doesn't exist anymore. That's why I knew I would be able to get away with it. There isn't a single person that can confirm or deny that I am a member." Dame was smiling to himself as he casually walked through the snow, his hands behind his head. "But doesn't that mean that there is no one that can prove you're a member as well, why would Gunther believe you?" Raze asked. "I'm not sure he did, but it would be risky for anyone to make a lie like that." Dame replied. "Besides, I actually know a few skills of the Noctis Clan. Do you remember him also stating not to show the skills?" </p><p> "The old leaders will perhaps remember what the skills look like, but none of them will be able to perform them, apart from doing a poor imitation. From what I know, there are also no records of the Noctis' Clan's skills that they used, at least in the Dark Faction." "Yet for some reason, there are the skill books in the Demonic Faction. Due to the skills themselves being from the Dark Faction, no one really in the Demonic Faction learned them. Remember how specific energy is best suited for certain skills." "So even if you learned it, it wouldn't be ideal for you, but maybe for one of your friends who have the Dark Qi in their bodies." Dame said. "For me though, I was bored and started to learn a few of the skills in there. So I was ready to demonstrate them if need be, and what better proof is that." Things were slowly starting to piece together in Raze's head, he had an idea as to why the techniques had ended up in the Demonic Faction. He remembered the writing on the cave wall, that he had decided to go to that mad place where the eyes of those chasing him didn't exist. Mad, could also be what some considered those from the Demonic Faction to be. 'Dame doesn't seem to know more about the Dark Faction founder, but it's clear that he was there hence why his skills were there. If I got to someone older or a higher up figure in the Demonic Faction, they might know.' 'I would be interested to know if the society or Alter were the ones that chased out the Dark Faction founder.' Raze thought. When reaching the barracks, the ground was rumbling underneath their feet. Through the snow they could see large mounds moving towards them. It was clear that rather than just one or two beasts, there were now groups going after them. "You might need my help with this one." Dame said. "I might, but don't go on them too hard, I still need to improve myself, and all the crystals are mine." Raze said. "Fine, as long as you give me a discount on the items when we sell them!" Dame shouted, charging in. The two of them fought against the large snakes one after the other, and Raze had no choice but to use his magic as well as his sword skills. It was the first time he was utilizing both of them in battle, and not long after that was when the others had come. They had arrived, and Gunther along with Liam, who had no clue what magic was, had witnessed it clearly for the first time. </p><p> Mass release goals! </p><p> 900 golden ticket's = 1 Extra Chapter </p><p> 2500 Power stoens = 1 Extra chapter n/(O????1n</p><p> 1 Castle gift and above = 1 Extra chapter </p><p> &nbsp;</p>
